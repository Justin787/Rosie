Thank you for downloading my antivirus program!
Rosie will take many hours to complete the scan, so be prepared.
I recommend running the program in manual malware delete mode, 
due to the lack of safety in the AutoDelete function.
Make sure to run as Administrator...

How To Use:
1.) Download ZIP folder
2.) Extract files to secure location on PC
3.) Use 7-Zip to extract MD5BaseMass001, MD5BaseMass002, MD5BaseMass003 to the same file
4.) Take MD5BaseMass.txt out of folder created by 7-Zip, so it is in the original folder next to MD5Base.txt
5.) Read disclaimer
6.) Run Rosie as administrator
7.) Follow instructions inside program

How Rosie Works:
Rosie dives deep into your PC to scan for any malware signatures
that may be found in my database. 
1.) Rosie finds a file.
2.) The file MD5 is identified.
3.) The file MD5 is compared to a list of malware MD5 hashes.
4.) Rosie will decide whether the file is safe or malicious.
5.) This process is repeated as Rosie scans your PC.

ROSIE IS IN ITS MOST BASIC FORM. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
